### PYTHON FILE PROCESSOR 

A Python application that reads data from files and stores the data into PostgreSQL database. Have implemented REST endpoints via which external users will interact with the application data. 

All the industry standard best practices in terms of logging, error handling, config file, code structuring are used in the application.

## Some Features of this project:

- Python (3.9) and VSCode IDE

- Organizing code with Classes and Modules

- Python logging - implement logging using basic config and file config

- Python error handling - handle exceptions.

- Python PostgreSQL database interaction - read from and write to PostgreSQL using psycopg2

- REST API in Python - create APIs using Python Flask framework

- Reading configuration from property file - avoid hardcoding of configurable properties

- Unit testing - test the application using unit-test package, e.g., PyTest
